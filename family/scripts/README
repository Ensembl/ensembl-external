# $Id$

This directory contains sh and perl scripts. It used to be in
ensembl-external/scripts/family, but has been moved to 
ensembl-external/family/scripts.

Also, most of the script originated from Anton. In order to keep his old
file names visible, I have not cvs removed them, but instead have put a 
die "superceded by suchandsuch"; message in.

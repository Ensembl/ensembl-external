The markov/ directory contains a program to transform blast scores into a
markov matrix.

The  mcl/ directory contains the programs for doing Stijn van Dongens MCL
clustering routine. It was cvs imported as

  cvs -d /nfs/ensembl/cvsroot import -I '!' ensembl-external/family/src/mcl MCL MCL_`date +"%Y-%m-%d"` 

Please use something similar when a new release is made. 
Users can  update their local working copies with 

    cvs  up -j rel_MCL2001-09-10 -j MCL  

(that is, if 'rel_MCL2001-09-10' is the latest MCL release that they
synchronized with).

The markov/ directory contains a program to transform blast scores into a
markov matrix.

NB: It used to be here a mcl/ directory containing the programs for
doing clustering routine. It is not here anymore, see ensembl-doc/family.txt for details.
In an initial 'cvs checkout', you would have this empty directory and
all the empty directories behind it. Just run 'cvs update -P' to prune
these empty directories from your ensembl-external working copy.

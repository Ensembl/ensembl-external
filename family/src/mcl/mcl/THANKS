Thanks to:

   Anton Enright
      for co-implementing threading and his interest and enthousiasm for mcl.
   Joost van Baal
      for packaging mcl and doing all the stuff I find dreadful but
      which he seems to like somehow. You know, system administration,
      making it work :) -- specifically, for autotooling mcl and
      setting up and maintaining the CVS tree.
   Jan van der Steen
      for sharing his very useful mempool routines, for exchanging
      and discussing ideas, and his comments on C programming at large.
      and for contributing the smart stuff in the zoem troff macros.
   Philip Lijnzaad
      for a useful bug report and giving advice.
   Rob Koopman
      for putting heap-selection to my attention, when I was using a
      less than dumb algorithm.
   Shawn Hoon
      for a useful bug report.
   Wouter Hanegraaf
      for making my Debian system run :)
   The Free Software Community
      for making the world a better place, software wise.

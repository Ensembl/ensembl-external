o  like to test with '-Wall -pedantic -ansi' c flags
   how to do that properly?

o   -I. -I. -I.. -I..

o  not all binaries need -lpthread

o  Not really a todo item, but rather recording a thought:
   I would like it best if

   aclocal.m4 bootstrap depcomp install-sh mkdinstalldirs stamp-h stamp-h.in

   Where all in a separate directory say named 'auto'.  Would that conflict
   with the standard setup of autotools, or would it be relatively painless to
   achieve?

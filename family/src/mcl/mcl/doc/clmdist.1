clmdist \- compute the split/join distance \fBsjd\fP between two partitions (clusterings)\&.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBclmdist\fP <file name> <file name>+
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBclmdist\fP computes the split/join distance \fBsjd\fP between two clusterings\&.
It can compute this distance for all pairs of distances in a set of clusterings\&.
Clusterings must be in the mcl matrix format (Cf\&. \fBmcx(5)\fP),
and are supplied on the command line as the names of the files in which
they are stored\&.

\fBsjd\fP is very handy in computing the consistency of two or more
clusterings of the same graph, or comparing clusterings made with different
resource (but otherwise identical) parameters\&. The latter is for finding out
whether you can settle for cheaper \fBmcl\fP settings, or whether you need to
switch to more expensive settings\&. The former is for finding out whether
clusterings are identical, conflicting, or whether one is (almost) a
subclustering of the other - mostly for comparing a set of clusterings of
different granularity, made by letting the \fBmcl\fP parameter \fB-I\fP vary\&.
The \fBEXAMPLES\fP section contains examples of all these \fBclmdist\fP uses,
and the use of \fBclminfo(1)\fP and \fBclmmeet(1)\fP is also
discussed there\&.

\fBsjd\fP is a metric distance on the space of partitions of
a set of a given fixed cardinality\&. It has the following linearity
property\&. Let \fBP1\fP and \fBP2\fP be partitions, then

\fBsjd\fP(\fBP1\fP, \fBP2\fP) = \fBsjd\fP(\fBP1\fP, \fBD\fP) + \fBsjd\fP(\fBP2\fP, \fBD\fP)

where \fBD\fP (for Dutch Doorsnede)
is the intersection of \fBP1\fP and \fBP2\fP, i\&.e\&. the unique clustering
that is both a subclustering of \fBP1\fP and \fBP2\fP \fIand\fP a superclustering of
all other subclusterings of \fBP1\fP and \fBP2\fP\&. Sloppily worded, \fBD\fP is the largest
subclustering of both \fBP1\fP and \fBP2\fP\&. See the \fBREFERENCES\fP section for
a pointer to the technical report in which \fBsjd\fP was first defined (and in
which the non-trivial triangle inequality is proven)\&.

Because it is useful to know whether one partition (or clustering)
is almost a subclustering of the other, \fBclmdist\fP returns the
two constituents \fBsjd\fP(\fBP1\fP,\fBD\fP) and \fBsjd\fP(\fBP2\fP,\fBD\fP)\&.

The output of \fBclmdist\fP is slightly different depending on whether two or
more than two clusterings are given\&. In the first case, one pair of numbers
is returned (the \fBsjd\fP constituents)\&. In the latter case, an array is
returned for which the upper triangular part contains all possible
distances\&. The array is extended with the (file) names of the clusterings\&.

Let \fBP1\fP and \fBP2\fP be two clusterings of a graph of cardinality \fBN\fP,
and suppose \fBclmdist\fP returns the integers \fBd1\fP and \fBd2\fP\&. You can think of
\fB100 * (d1 + d2) / N\fP as the percentage that \fBP1\fP and \fBP2\fP differ\&.
This interpretation is in fact slightly conservative\&.
The numerator is the number of nodes that need to be exchanged in order to
transform one into the other\&. This number may grow as large as
\fB2*N - 2*sqrt(N)\fP, so it would be justified to take 50 as a scaling
factor rather than 100\&.

For example, if \fBA\fP and \fBB\fP are both clusterings of a graph
on a set of 9058 nodes and \fBclmdist\fP returns [38, 2096], this conveys
that \fBA\fP is almost a subclustering of \fBB\fP (by splitting 38 nodes
in \fBA\fP we obtain a clustering \fBD\fP that is a subclustering of \fBB\fP),
and that \fBB\fP is much less granular than \fBA\fP\&. The latter is
because we can obtain \fBB\fP from \fBD\fP by \fIjoining\fP 2096 nodes
in some way\&.
.SH EXAMPLES

The following is an example of several \fBmcl\fP validation tools
applied to a set of clusterings on a protein graph of 9058 nodes\&.
In the first experiment, six
different clusterings were generated for different values of the inflation
parameter, which was respectively set to 1\&.2, 1\&.6, 2\&.0, 2\&.4, 2\&.8, and 3\&.2\&.
It should be noted that protein graphs seem somewhat special in that an
inflation parameter setting as low as 1\&.2 still produces a very acceptable
clustering\&. The six clusterings are scrutinized using \fBclmdist\fP,
\fBclminfo\fP, and \fBclmmeet\fP\&.
In the second experiment, four different clusterings were generated
with identical flow (i\&.e\&. inflation) parameter, but
with different resource parameters\&. \fBclmdist\fP is used to choose
a sufficient resource level\&.

High \fB-P/-S/-R\fP values make \fBmcl\fP more accurate but also
more time and memory consuming\&. Run \fBmcl\fP with different settings for these
parameters, holding other parameters fixed\&. If the expensive and supposedly
more accurate clusterings are very similar to the clusterings resulting from
cheaper settings, the cheaper setting is sufficient\&. If the distances
between cheaper clusterings and more expensive clusterings are large, this
is an indication that you need the expensive settings\&. In that case, you may
want to increase the \fB-P/-S/-R\fP parameters (or simply the
\fB-scheme\fP parameter) until associated
clusterings at nearby resource levels are very similar\&.

In this particular example, the validation tools do not reveal that one
clustering in particular can be chosen as \&'best\&', because all clusterings
seem at least acceptable\&. They do aid however in showing the relative
merits of each clusterings\&. The most important issue in this respect is
cluster granularity\&. The table below shows the output of \fBclminfo(1)\fP\&.

This data shows that there is exceptionally strong cluster structure present
in the input graph\&. The 1\&.2 clustering captures almost all edge mass using
only 2\&.5 percent of \&'area\&'\&. The 3\&.2 clustering still captures 82 percent of
the mass using less than 1 percent of area\&. We continue with looking at the
mutual consistency of the six clusterings\&. Below is a table that shows all
pairwise distances between the clusterings\&.

The table shows that the different clusterings are pretty consistent with
each other, because for two different clusterings it is generally true that
one is almost a subclustering of the other\&. The interpretation for the
distance between the 1\&.6 and the 3\&.2 clustering for example, is that by
rearranging 43 nodes in the 3\&.2 clustering, we obtain a subclustering of the
1\&.6 clustering\&. The table shows that for any pair of clusterings, at most
119 entries need to be rearranged in order to make one a subclustering of
the other\&.

The overall consistency becomes all the more clear by looking at the meet of
all the clusterings:

This shows that by rearranging only 283 nodes in the 3\&.2 clustering,
one obtains a subclustering of all other clusterings\&.

In the last experiment, \fBmcl\fP was run with inflation parameter 1\&.4,
for each of the four different preset pruning schemes \fCk=1,2,3,4\fR\&.
The \fBclmdist\fP distances between the different clusterings
are shown below\&.

This example is a little boring in that the cheapest scheme seems adequate\&.
If anything, the gaps between the \fCk=1\fR scheme and the rest are a little
larger than the three gaps between the \fCk=2\fR, \fCk=3\fR, and \fCk=4\fR
clusterings\&. Had all distances been much larger, then such an observation
would be reason to choose the \fCk=2\fR setting\&.

Note that you need not feel uncomfortable with the clusterings
still being different at high resource levels, if ever so slightly\&.
In all likelihood, there are anyway nodes which are not in any core of
attraction, and that are on the boundary between two or more clusterings\&.
They may go one way or another, and these are the nodes which
will go different ways even at high resource levels\&.
Such nodes may be stable in clusterings obtained for lower inflation
values (i\&.e\&. coarser clusterings), in which the different clusters
to which they are attracted are merged\&.

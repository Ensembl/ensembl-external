.SH NAME

clmmeet \- compute the intersection of a set of clusterings\&.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBclmmeet\fP -o <output file name> <file name>+
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBclmmeet\fP computes the intersection of a set of clusterings, that is,
the largest clustering that is a subclustering of all the clusterings
in the set\&. It stores the intersection (or meet) in the argument
to the \fB-o\fP flag, which must be the first option given\&.
All remaining arguments are interpreted as names of files containing
clusterings in mcl format (see \fBmcx(5)\fP), which must all
pertain to a set of the same cardinality\&.

This utility can be useful in measuring (in conjunction with
\fBclmdist(1)\fP) the consistency of a set of clusterings at different
levels of granularity \- if the meet of all those clusterings is close to
being a subclustering of each of them, consistency is good\&. See
\fBclmdist(1)\fP for an example\&.

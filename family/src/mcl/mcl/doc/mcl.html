<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<b>mcl</b> implements the <b>MCL algorithm</b>, short for the <b>Markov cluster
algorithm</b>, a cluster algorithm for graphs developed by Stijn van Dongen at
the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. The algorithm simulates flow using two simple algebraic
operations on matrices. The theory behind it is extensively described
elsewhere (see
<a href="#references">REFERENCES</a>). The program described here is a fast
threaded implementation written by the algorithm's creator with
contributions by several others. Anton Enright co-implemented threading; see
the
<a href="#history">HISTORY/CREDITS</a> section for a complete account. The implementation is
used for the TRIBES project in which large numbers of proteins are clustered
into families, and has become all the better from the feedback this has
generated.
See the
<a href="#applicability">APPLICABILITY</a> section for a description of the type of
graph <b>mcl</b> likes best, and for a qualitative assessment of its speed.

<p>
The <a href="#opt-I"><b>-I</b>&nbsp;<i>f</i> option</a> is the main control,
affecting cluster granularity. Using <b>mcl</b> is as simple as
typing (assuming a file <i>proteins</i> contains a matrix/graph
in <b>mcl</b> input format)

<pre>
   mcl proteins -I 2.0
</pre>

<p>
The above will result in a clustering written to the file
named <i>out.mcl</i>. The <b>mcl</b> input format is described in the
<a href="mcxformat.html">mcxformat</a> section. Clusterings are also stored as matrices
- this is again discussed in the <a href="mcxformat.html">mcxformat</a> section.
In finding good <b>mcl</b> parameter settings for a particular domain,
or in finding cluster structure at different levels of granularity,
one typically runs <b>mcl</b> multiple times for varying values of f (refer
to the <a href="#opt-I"><b>-I</b> option</a> for further information).

<p>
<b>mcl</b> expects a nonnegative matrix in the input file, or equivalently, a
weighted (possibly directed) graph. NOTE - <b>mcl</b> interprets the matrix
entries or graph edge weights as <b>similarities</b>, and it likes
<b>undirected input graphs</b> best. It can handle directed graphs, but any
node pair (i,j) for which w(i,j) is much smaller than w(j,i) or vice versa
will presumably have a slightly negative effect on the clusterings output by
<b>mcl</b>. Many such node pairs will have a distinctly negative effect, so try to
make your input graphs undirected. How your edge weights are computed may
affect <b>mcl</b>'s performance. In protein clustering, it is best to choose the
negated logarithm of the BLAST probabilities (see
<a href="#references">REFERENCES</a>).

<p>
<b>mcl</b>'s default parameters should make it quite fast in almost all
circumstances. Taking default parameters, <b>mcl</b> has been used to generate
good protein clusters on 133k proteins, taking 10 minutes running time on a
Compaq ES40 system with four alpha EV6.7 processors.

<p>
For large graphs, there are several groups of parameters available for
tuning the mcl computing process, should it be necessary.
The easiest thing
to do is just vary the <a href="#opt-scheme"><b>-scheme</b> option</a>. This
triggers different settings for the group of pruning parameters
<a href="#opt-P"><b>{</b><b>-p/-P</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-S</b>, and
<b>-pct</b><b>}</b></a>. The default setting corresponds with
<b>-scheme</b>&nbsp;<b>2</b>.
There is an additional group of control parameters
<a href="#opt--adapt"><b>{</b><b>--adapt</b>, <b>--rigid</b>, <b>-ae</b>,
<b>-af</b><b>}</b></a>, which may be helpful in speeding up <b>mcl</b>.
When doing multiple <b>mcl</b> runs for the same graphs with different
<b>-I</b> settings (for obtaining clusterings at different levels
of granularity), it can be useful to factor out the first bit
of computation that is common to all runs, by using
the <a href="#opt--expand-only"><b>--expand-only</b> option</a> one time
and then using <a href="#opt--inflate-first"><b>--inflate-first</b></a> for
each run in the set.
Whether <b>mcl</b> considers a graph large depends mainly on the graph
connectivity; a highly connected graph on 50,000 nodes is large to
<b>mcl</b> (so that you might want to tune resources) whereas a sparsely
connected graph on 500,000 nodes may be business as usual. If graphs
are really huge, the time to read a graph from file can be shortened
by converting the input graph from ascii mcl format to binary mcl
format with <a href="mcxconvert.html">mcxconvert</a>.

<p>
Two other groups of interest are the thread-related
options (you can specify the number of threads to use)
<a href="#opt-t"><b>{</b><b>-t</b>, <b>-te</b>, <b>-ti</b>,
<b>--clone</b>, <b>-cloneat</b><b>}</b></a>
and the verbosity-related options
<a href="#opt--verbose"><b>{</b><b>--verbose</b>, <b>--silent</b>, <b>-v</b>,
<b>-V</b><b>}</b></a>.
The actual settings are shown with <b>-z</b>, and for graphs with
at most 12 nodes or so you can view the MCL matrix iterands on screen
by supplying <a href="#opt--show"><b>--show</b></a> (this may give some
more feeling).

<p>
The first option is the input file name (see the <a href="mcxformat.html">mcxformat</a> section
for its expected format), or a single hyphen to read from stdin.
The rationale is that you typically do several runs with different
parameters, and in command line mode it is pleasant if you do not have
to skip over an immutable parameter all the time.

<p>
In the
<a href="#options">OPTIONS</a> section options are listed in order of
importance, with related options grouped together.

<p>
The creator of this page feels that manual pages are a valuable resource,
that online html documentation is also a good thing to have, and
that info pages are way <i>way</i> ahead of their time. The
<a href="#notes">NOTES</a> section explains how this page was created.

<a name="options"></a>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<dl compact>
<dt><a name="opt-I"></a><b>-I</b> f (<i>inflation</i>)
<dd>
Sets the main inflation value to f. This value is the main handle
for affecting cluster granularity. It is usually chosen somewhere
in the range [1.2-5.0]. <b>-I</b>&nbsp;<b>5.0</b> will tend to result
in fine-grained clusterings, and <b>-I</b>&nbsp;<b>1.2</b> will tend to
result in very coarse grained clusterings. Your mileage will vary
depending on the characteristics of your data. That is why it is
a good idea to test the quality and coherency of your clusterings
using <a href="clmdist.html">clmdist</a> and <a href="clminfo.html">clminfo</a>. This will most likely reveal that
certain values of <b>-I</b> are simply not right for your data. The
<a href="clmdist.html">clmdist</a> section contains a discussion of how to use the cluster
validation tools shipped with <b>mcl</b> (see the
<a href="#seealso">SEE ALSO</a> section).

<p>
A second option for affecting cluster granularity is the
<a href="#opt-c"><b>-c</b> option</a>.
It may possibly increase granularity.

<p>
With low values for <b>-I</b>, like <b>-I</b>&nbsp;<b>1.2</b>, you should be
prepared to use more resources in order to maintain quality of
clusterings, i.e. increase the arguments to the
<a href="#opt-P"><b>-P/-S/-R</b> options</a> or simply increase
the argument to <a href="#opt-scheme"><b>-scheme</b></a>.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-o"></a><b>-o</b> str (<i>fname</i>)
<dd>
Output the clustering to file named fname. The default file name
is out.mcl. It is possible to send the clustering to stdout
by supplying <b>-o</b>&nbsp;<b>-</b>. The clustering is output in the
mcl matrix format; see the <a href="mcxformat.html">mcxformat</a> section for
more information on this.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-c"></a><b>-c</b> f (<i>centering</i>)
<dd>
The larger the value of f the more nodes are attached
to themselves rather than their neighbours, the more
expansion (the spreading of flow through the graph) is
opposed, and the more fine-grained clusterings tend to be. f should be
chosen greater than or equal to 1.0. The default is f=1.0. This option
has a much weaker effect than the <b>-I</b> option, but it can be
useful depending on your data.

<p>
The following resource control options are discussed as a group:
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-p"></a><b>-p</b> f (<i>cutoff</i>)
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-P"></a><b>-P</b> n (<i>1/cutoff</i>)
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-S"></a><b>-S</b> s (<i>selection number</i>)
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-R"></a><b>-R</b> r (<i>recover number</i>)
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-pct"></a><b>-pct</b> pct (<i>recover percentage</i>)
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-scheme"></a><b>-scheme</b> k (<i>use a preset pruning scheme</i>)
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--show-schemes"></a><b>--show-schemes</b> (<i>show preset schemes</i>)
<br>
<br>
<dd>
If you do not know nor want to know the mcl internals, just ignore the
additional information below and follow the recommendations. They are
quite straightforward.

<p>
After computing a new (column stochastic) matrix vector during expansion
(which is matrix multiplication c.q. squaring), the vector is
successively exposed to different pruning strategies. The intent of
pruning is that many small entries are removed while retaining much of
the stochastic mass of the original vector. After pruning, vectors are
rescaled to be stochastic again. MCL iterands are theoretically known to
be sparse in a weighted sense, and this manoever effectively perturbs the
MCL process a little in order to obtain matrices that are genuinely
sparse, thus keeping the computation tractable. An example of monitoring
pruning can be found in the discussion of <b>-v</b>&nbsp;<b>pruning</b> under the
<a href="#opt--verbose"><b>--verbose</b> option</a>.

<p>
<b>mcl</b> proceeds as follows.
First, entries that are smaller than <i>cutoff</i> are removed,
resulting in a vector with at most <i>1/cutoff</i> entries.
The cutoff can be supplied either by <b>-p</b>, or as the inverse value
by <b>-P</b>. The latter is more intuitive, if your intuition is like
mine (and the P stands for precision or pruning by the way).
The cutoff just described is rigid; it is the same for all vectors. The
<a href="#opt--adapt"><b>--adapt</b> option</a> causes the computation of a
cutoff that depends on a vector's homogeneity properties, and this option
may speed up <b>mcl</b> considerably.

<p>
Second, if the remaining stochastic mass (i.e. the sum of all remaining
entries) is less than <i>pct</i>/100 and the number of remaining
entries is less than <i>r</i> (as specified by the <b>-R</b> flag),
<b>mcl</b> will try to regain ground by recovering the largest discarded
entries. The total number of entries is not allowed to grow larger than
<i>r</i>.
If recovery was not necessary, <b>mcl</b> tries to prune the vector further
down to at most <i>s</i> entries (if applicable), as specified by the
<b>-S</b> flag. If this results in a vector that satisfies the recovery
condition then recovery is attempted, exactly as described above.
The latter will not occur of course if <i>r</i> &lt;= <i>s</i>.

<p>
The default setting is something like <b>-P</b>&nbsp;<b>2000</b> <b>-S</b>&nbsp;<b>500</b>
<b>-R</b>&nbsp;<b>600</b>. Check the <b>-z</b> flag to be sure. There is a set
of precomposed settings, which can be triggered with the
<a href="#opt-scheme"><b>-scheme</b>&nbsp;<i>k</i> option</a>. <i>k</i>=2 is the default
scheme; higher values for <i>k</i> result in costlier and
more accurate computations (vice versa for lower, cheaper, and less
accurate). The schemes are listed using the
<b>--show-schemes</b> option. It is advisable to use the
<b>-scheme</b> option only in interactive mode, and to use the explicit
expressions when doing batch processing. The reason is that there
is <i>no guarantee whatsoever</i> that the schemes will not change
between different releases. This is because the scheme options
should reflect good general purpose settings, and it may become
appararent that other schemes are better.

<p>
Note that 'less accurate' or 'more accurate' computations
may still generate the same output clusterings. Use <b>clmdist</b>
to compare output clusterings for different resource parameters.
Refer to <a href="clmdist.html">clmdist</a> for a discussion of this issue.

<p>
As a reminder of the existence of pruning and its importance for both
speed and accuracy, <b>mcl</b> reports three numbers when it is done, the
'jury marks'.
These are somewhat (but not totally) indicative for the quality of
pruning, and they are excerpts from the output produced by
<b>-v</b>&nbsp;<b>pruning</b>, namely the numbers listed under the <i>nx</i> column
for the three first iterations. Each number gives the average stochastic
mass of the <b>nx</b> worst instances of pruning, i.e. those vectors
for which the most mass was removed. The average is listed as a
percentage. The numbers should preferably be higher than 70. If they are
in the vicinity of 80 or 90, <b>mcl</b> is doing fine as far as pruning is
concerned. Choose a higher scheme if you think them too low.
For very dense graphs that do have strong cluster structure,
the jury marks can sink as low as to the 30's
and 40's, but the clusterings generated by <b>mcl</b> may still be good.
Refer to the <a href="#opt-v"><b>-v</b> option</a> for more information, and
note that the jury becomes friendlier, resp. harsher when the
<b>-nx</b> option is increased/decreased.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-warn-pct"></a><b>-warn-pct</b> k (<i>prune warn percentage</i>)
<dt><a name="opt-warn-factor"></a><b>-warn-factor</b> k (<i>prune warn factor</i>)
<dd>
The two options <b>-warn-pct</b> and <b>-warn-factor</b> relate to
warnings that may be triggered once the <i>initial</i> pruning of a vector
is completed. The idea is to issue warnings if initial pruning almost
completely destroys a computed vector, as this may be a sign that the
pruning parameters should be changed. It depends on the mass remaining
after initial pruning whether a warning will be issued. If that mass is
less than <i>warn-pct</i> or if the number of remaining entries is smaller
by a factor <i>warn-factor</i> than both the number of entries originally
computed <i>and</i> the recovery number, in that case, <b>mcl</b> will issue a
warning.

<p>
<b>-warn-pct</b> takes an integer between 0 and 100 as parameter,
<b>-warn-factor</b> takes a real positive number. They default to
something like 30 and 50.0. If you want to see less warnings, decrease
<i>warn-pct</i> and increase <i>warn-factor</i>. Set <i>warn-factor</i> to zero
if you want no warnings.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--rigid"></a><b>--rigid</b> (<i>pruning</i>)
<dd>
See the <b>--adapt</b> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-ae"></a><b>-ae</b> f (<i>adaptive pruning exponent</i>)
<dd>
See the <b>--adapt</b> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-af"></a><b>-af</b> f (<i>adaptive pruning factor</i>)
<dd>
See the <b>--adapt</b> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--adapt"></a><b>--adapt</b> (<i>pruning</i>)
<dd>
The default <b>mcl</b> pruning behaviour as described under
the <a href="#opt-P"><b>-P</b> option</a> is called <i>rigid pruning</i>
(it being the default renders the switch <b>--rigid</b>
currently useless), refering to the fact that the first stage
of pruning removes entries smaller than a fixed threshold.
The options discussed here enable the computation of a threshold that
depends on the homogeneity characteristics of a vector. This behaviour is
triggered by supplying <b>--adapt</b>.

<p>
The <b>--adapt</b> behaviour only affects the first pruning stage, c.q.
the computation of the first threshold (see the discussion under the
<a href="#opt-P"><b>-P</b> option</a>). It does not interfere with either
selection or recovery. It is affected however by the threshold as
specified by the <b>-P</b> option. When using <b>--adapt</b>, you
typically use the <b>-P</b> option as well, and you can and should use
a higher value then you would without using <b>--adapt</b>.

<p>
All that said, <b>--adapt</b> triggers this behaviour: Given a
stochastic vector v, its mass center of order two is computed,
which is the sum of each entry squared. The mass center of v,
call it c, is strongly related to its homogeneity properties
(see
<a href="#references">REFERENCES</a>). The threshold T is computed as 1/f *
pow(c, e), where e and f are the arguments to the <b>-af</b>&nbsp;<i>f</i>
and <b>-ae</b>&nbsp;<i>e</i> options respectively (check <b>-z</b>
for the respective defaults).
For either e or f decreasing it means that T becomes larger.
<i>Finally, T is maxed with the rigid threshold value</i>, which
can be altered using either <b>-p</b>&nbsp;<i>f</i> or <b>-P</b>&nbsp;<i>n</i>.
The latter is why you should increase the <b>-P</b> parameter n
(so that the rigid threshold is decreased) once you switch to
adaptive pruning. The adaptive threshold should be the main factor
controlling pruning, with the rigid threshold acting as a safeguard
that does not take over too often.

<p>
This may seem complicated, but the rules are actually quite simple, and
you may just disregard the definition of T. The usefulness of these
options will vary. If you want to speed up <b>mcl</b>, try it out
and add <b>--adapt</b> to your settings.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-nx"></a><b>-nx</b> x (<i>track worst n</i>)
<dd>
See in the <b>--verbose</b> option below the discussion
of the <i>pruning</i> mode.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-ny"></a><b>-ny</b> y (<i>track worst n</i>)
<dd>
See in the <b>--verbose</b> option below the discussion
of the <i>pruning</i> mode.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-v"></a><b>-v</b> str (<i>verbosity type on</i>)
<dd>
See the <b>--verbose</b> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-V"></a><b>-V</b> str (<i>verbosity type off</i>)
<dd>
See the <b>--verbose</b> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--silent"></a><b>--silent</b> (<i>very</i>)
<dd>
See the <b>--verbose</b> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--verbose"></a><b>--verbose</b> (<i>very</i>)
<dd>
These are the different verbosity modes:

<p>
<b>progress</b><br>
<b>pruning</b><br>
<b>explain</b><br>
<b>all</b>

<p>
where <i>all</i> means all three previous modes.
<b>--verbose</b> and <b>-v</b>&nbsp;<b>all</b>
turn them all on, <b>--silent</b> and <b>-V</b>&nbsp;<b>all</b>
turn them all off. <b>-v</b>&nbsp;<i>str</i> and <b>-V</b>&nbsp;<i>str</i>
turn on/off the single mode <i>str</i> (for <i>str</i>
equal to one of <b>progress</b>, <b>pruning</b>, or <b>explain</b>).
Each verbosity mode is given its own entry below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><b>-v</b>&nbsp;<b>progress</b>
<dd>
This mode causes <b>mcl</b> to emit an ascii gauge
for each single matrix multiplication. It uses some
default length for the gauge, which can be altered by
the <b>-progress</b>&nbsp;<i>k</i> option. Simply using the latter
will also turn on this verbosity mode.
This mode can give you quickly an idea how long an <b>mcl</b>
run might take. If you use threading
(see the <a href="#opt-t"><b>-t</b> option</a> and its friends),
this option may slow down the program a little (relative to
<b>-V</b>&nbsp;<b>progress</b>, not relative to a single-CPU <b>mcl</b> run).
<br>
<br>
<dt><b>-v</b>&nbsp;<b>explain</b>
<dd>
This mode causes the output of explanatory headers illuminating the
output generated with the <b>pruning</b> verbosity mode.
<br>
<br>
<dt><b>-v</b>&nbsp;<b>pruning</b>
<dd>
The pruning process takes place during <i>expansion</i>, and is needed
because expansion causes matrices to fill very rapidly. Expansion is
nothing but taking the square of a stochastic matrix. The square is
computed by successively computing its columns, which are stochastic
vectors. A new vector is first computed, and is then exposed to pruning.
Pruning consists of either one or two out of <i>selection</i> and
<i>recovery</i> - see the discussion of <b>-S</b> and <b>-R</b> under
the <a href="#opt-P"><b>-P</b> option</a>.

<p>
Pruning verbosity mode causes <b>mcl</b> to emit several statistics related to
the pruning process, each of which is described below. Use
<b>-v</b>&nbsp;<b>explain</b> to get explanatory headers in the output as well.

<p align=justify>
<b>Selection and recovery</b>
<br>
The number of selections and recoveries <b>mcl</b> had to perform during each
iteration is shown. It also shows the number of vectors for which the
mass after final pruning was below the fraction defined by the
<a href="#opt-pct"><b>-pct</b> option</a> as a percentage (default probably 90
or 95).

<p align=justify>
<b>Initial and final vector footprint distributions</b>
<br>
The distribution of the vector footprints (i.e. the number of nonzero
entries) before and after pruning is shown. This is assembled in a terse
(horrid if you will) ascii output format, looking as follows
(with some context stripped, noting that the data for three
multiplications is shown):

<pre>

<p>
This particular output was generated (and truncated after three rounds
of expansion and inflation) from clustering
a protein graph on 9058 nodes with settings <b>-I</b>&nbsp;<b>1.4</b>,
<b>-P</b>&nbsp;<b>2000</b>, <b>-S</b>&nbsp;<b>500</b>, <b>-R</b>&nbsp;<b>600</b>,
and <b>-pct</b>&nbsp;<b>95</b> (which was supplied more succinctly
as <b>-scheme</b>&nbsp;<b>2</b> <b>-pct</b>&nbsp;<b>95</b>).

<p>
The header entries 8532c85.. with the zeroes on top indicate
thresholds going from 8000, 5000, 2000, 1250, 800, all the way down
to 30, 20, and 12. The character 'c' signifies the base 12.5 (for
no apparent reason). The
second entry '2' (after '0') signifies that roughly 20 percent
of all the vectors had footprint (#nonzero entries) between 800 and
1250. Likewise, 80 percent had footprint between 500 and 800. The '0'
entries signify a fraction somewhere below 5 percent, and the '@'
entries signify a fraction somewhere above 95 percent.

<p>
Two columns are listed, one for the composed vector footprints
(i.e. after squaring), and the other for the vector
footprints <i>right after initial pruning took place</i> (i.e. before
selection and recovery, after either adaptive or rigid pruning).
This may give an idea of the soundness of the initial pruning
process (overly severe, or overly mild), and the extent
to which you want to apply selection and/or recovery.

<p align=justify>
<b>Initial and final vector mass distributions</b>
<br>
The mass averages of the pruned vectors after the first selection
stage are shown, and the mass averages of the vectors as <i>finally
pruned</i>, i.e. after selection and recovery. Note that the latter
corresponds to a different stage than what is shown for the vector
footprints, if either selection or recovery is turned on.
The mass averages are shown as percentages: '88' means that overall
88 percent of the stochastic mass of the matrix was kept. For both
cases, three averages are shown: the average of all vectors,
the average of the worst x cases, and the average of the worst y
cases. The values x and y default to something like x=10 and y=100;
check the <a href="#opt-z"><b>-z</b> option</a> to be sure. They can be
changed using <b>-nx</b>&nbsp;<b>x</b> and <b>-ny</b>&nbsp;<b>y</b>.
The jury marks refered to earlier are in this particular case [86,91,94].

<p>
In the example above it is clearly seen that many entries could be
removed while retaining much of the stochastic mass. The effect of the
recovery (<b>-R</b>) parameter is also clear: the final averages are
higher than the initial averages, as a result of <b>mcl</b> undoing some
overenthousiastic pruning.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-progress"></a><b>-progress</b> k (<i>gauge</i>)
<dd>
If k&gt;0 then for each matrix multiplication <b>mcl</b> will print an
ascii gauge telling how far it is. The gauge will be (in some
cases approximately) k characters long. If k&lt;0 then <b>mcl</b> will
emit a gauge that is extended by one character after every |k|
vectors computed. For large graphs, this option has been known
to ease the pain of impatience. If k=0 then <b>mcl</b> will print a
message only after every matrix multiplication, and not during
matrix multiplication. This can be useful when you want <b>mcl</b> to be
as speedy as possible, for example when using parallellized mode
(as monitoring progress requires thread communication).
For parallellization (by threading) see the
<a href="#opt-t"><b>-t</b> option</a>.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-te"></a><b>-te</b> k (<i>#expansion threads</i>)
<dd>
See the <b>-t</b>&nbsp;<i>k</i> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-ti"></a><b>-ti</b> k (<i>#inflation threads</i>)
<dd>
See the <b>-t</b>&nbsp;<i>k</i> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--clone"></a><b>--clone</b> (<i>when threading</i>)
<dd>
See the <b>-t</b>&nbsp;<i>k</i> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-cloneat"></a><b>-cloneat</b> n (<i>trigger</i>)
<dd>
See the <b>-t</b>&nbsp;<i>k</i> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-t"></a><b>-t</b> k (<i>#threads</i>)
<dd>
The <b>-t</b> options are self-explanatory. Note that threading
inflation is hardly useful, as inflation is orders of magnitude
faster than expansion. Also note that threading is only useful
if you have a multi-processor system.

<p>
The <b>--clone</b>
option says to give each thread its own copy of the matrix being
expanded/squared. The latter option can be further controlled
using the <b>--cloneat</b>&nbsp;<i>k</i> option. Copies are only made if
the source matrix (the one to be squared) has on average at least
k positive entries per vector.

<p>
When threading, it is best not to turn on pruning verbosity
mode if you are letting mcl run unattended, unless you want to
scrutinize its output later. This is because it makes <b>mcl</b> run
somewhat slower, although the difference is not dramatic.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-l"></a><b>-l</b> n (<i>initial iteration number</i>) (small letter ell)
<dd>
The number of times <b>mcl</b> will use a different inflation value
before it switches to the (main) inflation given by the <b>-I</b>
(capital eye) option. The different value is called <i>initial
inflation</i> and is tunable using the <a href="#opt-i"><b>-i</b>&nbsp;<i>f</i>
option</a> (default value f=2.0). The default value (to <b>-l</b>)
is zero. This option supplies new ways of affecting cluster
granularity, e.g. by supplying

<pre>
   mcl proteins -i 1.4 -l 2 -I 4.0
</pre>

<p>
one lets expansion prevail during the first two iterations,
followed by inflation catching up (in a figurative way of writing).
This may be useful in certain cases, but this type of experiment
is <i>certainly secondary</i> to simply varying <b>-I</b> (capital eye).
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-L"></a><b>-L</b> n (<i>main iteration number</i>)
<dd>
Normally, <b>mcl</b> computes the MCL process until it has converged
fully to a doubly idempotent matrix. The number of iterations
required is typically somewhere in the range 10-100.
The first few iterations generally take the longest time.
The <b>-L</b> option can be used to specify the number of
iterations <b>mcl</b> may do at most. When this number is reached,
<b>mcl</b> will output the clustering associated with the iterand
last computed.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-i"></a><b>-i</b> f (<i>initial inflation</i>)
<dd>
The inflation value used during the first n iterations,
where n is specified by the <b>-l</b> (ell) option.
By default, n=0 and f=2.0.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-a"></a><b>-a</b> f (<i>loop weight</i>)
<dd>
<b>Deprecated</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the <a href="#opt-c"><b>-c</b> option</a>,
except that it adds loops of absolute weight. This can be intuitive
when testing with simple graphs, however, using <b>-c</b>&nbsp;<b>f</b>
will in this case have exactly the same effect as <b>-a</b>&nbsp;<b>f</b>,
so do use the former.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-dumpi"></a><b>-dumpi</b> i:j (<i>interval i..j-1</i>)
<dd>
Dump during iterations i..j-1. See the <b>-dump</b>&nbsp;<i>str</i> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-dumpm"></a><b>-dumpm</b> k (<i>dump i+0..i+k..</i>)
<dd>
Sampling rate: select only these iterations in the dump interval.
See the <b>-dump</b>&nbsp;<i>str</i> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-dumpstem"></a><b>-dumpstem</b> stem (<i>file stem</i>)
<dd>
Set the the stem for file names of dumped
objects (default <i>mcl</i>). See the <b>-dump</b>&nbsp;<i>str</i> option below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-dump"></a><b>-dump</b> str (<i>type</i>)
<dd>
<i>str</i> can be of the following types.

<p>
<b>att</b><br>
<b>ite</b><br>
<b>cls</b>

<p>
Repeated use is allowed. The <b>att</b> option says to output a vector
measuring for each node how much it is attracted to itself (which
measures the extent to which nodes are situated in the core of a
cluster). It is somewhat forlorn because the other mcl utilities
(see the
<a href="#seealso">SEE ALSO</a> section) can not yet utilize its output.
The <b>ite</b> option writes <b>mcl</b> iterands to file. The <b>cls</b>
option writes clusterings associated with <b>mcl</b> iterands to file.

<p>
The <b>-dumpstem</b> sets the stem for file names of dumped
objects (default <i>mcl</i>). The <b>-dumpi</b> and <b>-dumpm</b>
allow a selection of iterands to be made.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-digits"></a><b>-digits</b> n (<i>printing precision</i>)
<dd>
See the <a href="#opt--show"><b>--show</b> option</a> below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--show"></a><b>--show</b> (<i>print matrices to screen</i>)
<dd>
Print matrices to screen. The number of significant digits to be
printed can be tuned with <b>-digits</b>&nbsp;<i>n</i>. An 80-column screen
allows graphs (matrices) of size up to 12(x12) to be printed with
three digits precision (behind the comma), and of size up to 14(x14)
with two digits. This can give you an idea of how <b>mcl</b> operates,
and what the effect of pruning is. Use e.g. <b>-S</b>&nbsp;<b>6</b> for such
a small graph and view the MCL matrix iterands with <b>--show</b>.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--ascii"></a><b>--ascii</b> (<i>output format</i>)
<dd>
See the <a href="#opt--binary"><b>--binary</b> option</a> below.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--binary"></a><b>--binary</b> (<i>output format</i>)
<dd>
Write the resulting clustering in binary mcl format rather
than ascii mcl format (the default). Note that <b>mcxconvert</b>
can be used to convert each one into the other.
See <a href="mcxformat.html">mcxformat</a> and <a href="mcxconvert.html">mcxconvert</a> for more information.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--overlap"></a><b>--overlap</b> (<i>keep it</i>)
<dd>
Keep overlap. In theory, <b>mcl</b> may generate a clustering that
contains overlap, although this almost never happens in practice,
as it requires some particular type of symmetry to be present in
the input graph (not just any symmetry will do). Mathematically
speaking, this is a conjecture and not a theorem, but I am willing
to eat my shoe if it does not hold (for marzipan values
of shoe). It is easy though to construct an input graph for which
certain <b>mcl</b> settings result in overlap - for example a line graph
on an odd number of nodes. The default is to remove overlap should
it occur.

<p>
This option has more than theoretical use because <b>mcl</b> is able
to generate clusterings associated with intermediate iterands.
For these clusterings, overlap is more than a theoretical
possibility, and will often occur. If you specify
the <a href="#opt-L"><b>-L</b>&nbsp;<i>k</i></a> option, <b>mcl</b> will output the
clustering associated with the last iterand computed, and
it may well contain overlap.

<p>
This option has no effect on the clusterings that are
output when using <a href="#opt-dump"><b>-dump</b>&nbsp;<i>cls</i></a> -
the default for those is that overlap is not touched,
and this default can not yet be overridden.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--inflate-first"></a><b>--inflate-first</b> (<i>rather then expand</i>)
<dd>
Normally, <b>mcl</b> will take the input graph/matrix, make it stochastic, and
start computing an <b>mcl</b> process, where expansion and inflation are
alternated. This option changes that to alternation of inflation and
expansion, i.e. inflation is the first operator to be applied. This is
intended for use with an input matrix that was generated with the
<b>--expand-only</b> option (see below).
If you do multiple <b>mcl</b> runs for the same graph, then the first step will
be the same for all runs, namely computing the square of the input
matrix. With the pair of <b>--inflate-first</b> and
<b>--expand-only</b> this bit of computing can be factored out.
<b>NOTE</b> this option assumes that the input matrix is stochastic
(as it will be when generated with <b>--expand-only</b>.
The <b>--inflate-first</b> option renders all options useless that will
otherwise affect the input matrix, and precisely these options <i>do</i>
affect the matrix resulting from using <b>--expand-only</b>. See the
entry below for more information.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt--expand-only"></a><b>--expand-only</b> (<i>factor out computation</i>)
<dd>
This option makes <b>mcl</b> compute just the square of the input graph/matrix,
and write it to the file name supplied with the <b>-o</b> flag, or to
the default file named out.mce. <b>NOTE</b> in this case the output matrix
is <i>not</i> a clustering. The intended use is that the output matrix is
used as input for <b>mcl</b> with the <b>--inflate-first</b> switch turned
on, so that multiple <b>mcl</b> runs need not redo the same computation (the
first expansion step).

<p>
Note that the <a href="#opt-scheme"><b>-scheme</b> parameters</a> affect the
matrix computed with <b>--expand-only</b>. Other options that affect
the matrix resulting from this option:
<a href="#opt-preprune"><b>-preprune</b></a>, <a href="#opt-c"><b>-c</b></a>,
and <a href="#opt-digits"><b>-digits</b></a>. The latter option
sets the precision for output in native ascii format.
This is overloading the <b>-digits</b> option, as it has a different
meaning if <b>--expand-only</b> is not supplied.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-preprune"></a><b>-preprune</b> n (<i>input matrix</i>)
<dd>
For each column vector (node) in the input matrix (graph) <b>mcl</b> will
keep the n entries (outgoing edges) of that vector (node) that
have largest weight and remove the rest.
<br>
<br>
<dt><a name="opt-z"></a><b>-z</b> (<i>show settings</i>)
<dd>
Show current settings for tunable parameters.
<b>--show-settings</b> is a synonym.
<br>
<br>
<dt><b>That's All Folks</b>
<dd>
for now.

<a name="applicability"></a>
<h2>APPLICABILITY</h2>

<p>
<b>mcl</b> will work very well for graphs in which the diameter of the natural
clusters is not too large. The presence of many edges between different
clusters is not problematic; as long as there is cluster structure, <b>mcl</b>
will find it. It is less likely to work well for graphs with clusters
(inducing subgraphs) of large diameter, e.g. grid-like graphs derived from
Euclidean data. So <b>mcl</b> in its canonical form is certainly not fit for
boundary detection or image segmentation. I experimented with a modified
<b>mcl</b> and image segmentation in the thesis pointed to below (see
<a href="#references">REFERENCES</a>). This was fun and not entirely unsuccesful, but not
something to be pursued further.

<p>
<b>mcl</b> likes <i>undirected input graphs best</i>, and it really dislikes graphs
with node pairs (i,j) for which an arc going from i to j is present and the
counter-arc from j to i is absent. Try to make your input graph undirected.
Furthermore, <b>mcl</b> interprets edge weights in graphs as similarities. If you
are used to working with dissimilarities, you will have to convert those to
similarities using some conversion formula. The most important thing is
that you feel confident that the similarities are reasonable, i.e. if X is
similar to Y with weight 2, and X is similar to Z with weight 200, then this
should mean that the similarity of Y (to X) is neglectible compared with the
similarity of Z (to X).

<p>
<b>mcl</b> is probably not suited for clustering <i>tree graphs</i>. This is because
mcl works best if there are multiple paths between different nodes in the
natural clusters, but in tree graphs there is only one path between any pair
of nodes. Trees are too sparse a structure for <b>mcl</b> to work on.

<p>
<b>mcl</b> may well be suited for clustering <i>lattices</i>. It will depend
on the density characteristics of the lattice, and the conditions for
success are the same as those for clustering graphs in general: The
diameter of the natural clusters should not be too large.
<b>NOTE</b> when clustering a lattice, you <i>have</i> to cluster
the underlying undirected graph, and not the directed graph that represents
the lattice itself. The reason is that one has to allow <b>mcl</b> (or any other
cluster algorithm) to 'look back in time', so to speak. Clustering and
directionality bite each other (long discussion omitted).

<p>
<b>mcl</b> has a worst-case time complexity O(N*k^2), where N is the number of
nodes in the graph, and k is the maximum number of neighbours tracked during
computations. k depends on the <b>-P</b> and <b>-S</b> options. If the
<b>-S</b> option is used (which is the default setting) then k equals the
value corresponding with this option. Typical values for k are in the range
500..1000. The average case is much better than the worst case though, as
cluster structure itself has the effect of helping <b>mcl</b>'s pruning schemes,
certainly if the diameter of natural clusters is not large.

<h2>HISTORY/CREDITS</h2>

<p>
The MCL algorithm was conceived in spring 1996 by the present author.
The first implementation of the MCL algorithm followed that spring
and summer. It was written in Perl and proved the viability of
the algorithm. The implementation described here began its life in
autumn 1997. The first versions of the vital matrix library
were designed jointly by Stijn van Dongen and Annius Groenink in
the period Oktober 1997 - May 1999. The efficient matrix-vector
multiplication routine was written by Annius. This routine is
without significant changes still one of the cornerstones of this
MCL implementation.

<p>
Since May 1999 all MCL libraries have seen much development and
redesign by the present author. Matrix-matrix multiplication has been
rewritten several times to take full advantage of the sparseness
properties of the stochastic matrices brought forth by the MCL
algorithm. This mostly concerns the issue of pruning - removal of
small elements in a stochastic column in order to keep matrices
sparse.

<p>
Very instructive was that around April 2001 Rob Koopman pointed out
that selecting the k largest elements out of a collection of n is
best done using a min-heap. This was the key to the second major
rewrite (now counting three) of the MCL pruning schemes, resulting in
much faster code, generally producing a more accurate computation of
the MCL process.

<p>
In May 2001 Anton Enright initiated the parallellization of the
<b>mcl</b> code and threaded inflation. From this example, Stijn threaded
expansion. This was great, as the MCL data structures and operands
(normal matrix multiplication and Hadamard multiplication) just beg
for parallellization.

<p>
Joost van Baal set up the <b>mcl</b> CVS tree and packaged <b>mcl</b> for Debian
GNU/Linux. He completely autotooled the sources, so much so that at first I
found it hard to find them back amidst bootstrap, aclocal.m4, depcomp, and
other beauties.

<p>
Jan van der Steen shared his elegant mempool code. Philip Lijnzaad
and Shawn Hoon sent useful bug reports.

<a href="mcxformat.html">mcxformat</a> - a description of the mcl matrix format.

<p>
<a href="mcx.html">mcx</a> - an interpreter for a stack language that enables
interaction with the <b>mcl</b> matrix libraries. It can be used both from the
command line and interactively, and supports a rich set of operations such
as transposition, scaling, column scaling, multiplication, Hadamard powers
and products, et cetera. The general aim is to provide handles for simple
number and matrix arithmetic,
and for graph, set, and clustering operations. The following is
a very simple example of implementing and using <b>mcl</b> in this language.

<pre>
 2.0 .i def                    # define inflation value.
 /small lm                     # load matrix in file 'small'.
 dim id add                    # add identity matrix.
 st .x def                     # make stochastic, bind to x.
 { xpn .i infl vm } .mcl def   # define one mcl iteration.
 20 .x .mcl repeat             # iterate  20 times
 imac                          # interpret matrix as clustering.
 vm                            # view matrix (clustering).
</pre>

<p>
One of the more interesting things that can be done is doing mcl runs
with more complicated inflation profiles than the two-constant approach used
in <b>mcl</b> itself.

<p>
Several other utilities come with <b>mcl</b>, facilitating analysis and
comparison of different clusterings.

<p>
<a href="clmdist.html">clmdist</a> - compute the split/join distance between two
partitions. The split/join distance is better suited for measuring partition
similarity than the long-known equivalence mismatch coefficient. The former
measures the number of node moves required to transform one partition into
the other, the latter measures differences between volumes of edges of
unions of complete graphs associated with partitions.

<p>
<a href="clminfo.html">clminfo</a> - compute a performance measure saying how well
a clustering captures the edge weights of the input graph. Useful
for comparing different clusterings on the same graph, best used in
conjunction with <b>clmdist</b> - because comparing clusterings at
different levels of granularity should somewhat change the performance
interpretation. The latter issue is discussed in the <a href="clmdist.html">clmdist</a>
entry.

<p>
<a href="clmmeet.html">clmmeet</a> - compute the intersection of a set of clusterings,
i.e. the largest clustering that is a subclustering of all. Useful
for measuring the consistency of a set of different clusterings
at supposedly different levels of granularity (in conjunction with
<b>clmdist</b>).

<p>
<a href="clmconf.html">clmconf</a> - for inspecting local cluster structure.
Computes how well nodes fit into the cluster
in which they are located (for a given clustering) by looking at
the (weighted) percentage of its edges going to that same cluster.
Computes also the cohesiveness of a cluster, by computing and averaging
the above over all nodes in a cluster. Useful for inspecting local
cluster structure.

<p>
<a href="mcxsubs.html">mcxsubs</a> - compute a submatrix of a given matrix, where row
and column index sets can be specified as lists of indices combined
with list of clusters in a given clustering. Useful for inspecting
local cluster structure.

<p>
<a href="mcxconvert.html">mcxconvert</a> - convert matrices from ascii mcl format to
binary mcl format or vice versa.

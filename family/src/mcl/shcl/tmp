   for each arg, make one or more vectors.
   do this via ilist.

   default case: integer set generates one ilist,
   each entry of which represents a cluster. The
   corresponding clusters are merged.

   treat the 5~9 case as special (generates vector
   for each index).

   how to write down ranges?
   make range separator a customizable global variable.
   default: '-'

   were to put VectorFromIlist?
   in ilist.c, of la.c?

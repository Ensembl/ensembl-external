c: specify columns indices by taking the set yielded by poly-spec.
C: specify columns indices by taking the complement of this set.

r: specify row indices by taking the set yielded by poly-spec.
R: specify row indices by taking the complement of this set.

Omitting an 'r'/'R' specification silently implies taking all possible
entries for the row specification.
Omitting a 'c'/'C' specification silently implies taking all possible
entries for the column specification.

                     <poly-spec> is allowed to be the empty string.

<idx-list>     =     comma-separated list of indices and ranges of indices,
                     e.g.  0,1,3-5,4,8,6-10. Overlap and repeat is allowed.

                     <idx-list> is allowed to be the empty string.

i: specify a set of indices as the set yielded by idx-list.
I: specify a set of indices as the complement of this set.

s: specify a set of indices by interpreting each entry in idx-list
      as the index of a cluster, and take the union of all indices
      in all clusters thus specified.
S: specify a set of indices by interpreting each entry in idx-list
      as the index of a cluster, and take the complement of the union
      of all indices in all clusters thus specified.

cr:s14
   'Diagonal' submatrix corresponding with cluster indexed 14: (diagonal
   means row and column indices are taken from the same set).

r:i1-10,12s108,106c:s14
   Row indices are from the set {1-10,12} plus the indices in clusters
   108 and 106, column indices are from cluster 14.

cR:s14 | c:s14R:s14 | c:s14r:S14
   Column entries *in* cluster 14 and row entries *not in* cluster 14:

The specification ':' yields the full original matrix ('rc:I' and 'RC:i'
do the same), this can be useful if you want the original matrix in
tagged form, using --cltags.

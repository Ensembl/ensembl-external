   cr:s....i....
   cR:i....s....
   RC:s....i....

   c:s.....i....r:i.....s......
   et cetera.

   strstr(arg, "crCR")
      test whether following char is one of the other.
      introduce variable which         ->  r/c
      introduce variables rComplement  ->  0,1
                          cComplement  ->  0,1

      if that be the case, diagonal block specification.



   i...s... part: do separate searches for both, and
   set pointer. If there is not a cr specification,
   then search further for the other, and set pointer.


   obtain 'iI....' part and 'sS.....' part.
   interpret as vector, possibly take complement.

=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::ExternalData::Family::DBSQL::BaseAdaptor - Base Adaptor for DBSQL adaptors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # base adaptor provides
    
    # SQL prepare function
    $adaptor->prepare("sql statement");

    # get of root db object
    $adaptor->db();

    # delete memory cycles
    $adaptor->deleteObj();

    # constructor, ok for inheritence
    $adaptor = Bio::EnsEMBL::DBSQL::ClassWhichInheritsFromBaseAdaptor->new($dbobj)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a true base class for Adaptors in the Ensembl DBSQL
system. Original idea from Arne


Adaptors are expected to have the following functions

    $obj = $adaptor->fetch_by_dbID($internal_id);

which builds the object from the primary key of the object. This
function is crucial because it allows adaptors to collaborate
relatively independently of each other - in other words, we can change
the schema under one adaptor without too many knock on changes through
the other adaptors.

Most adaptors will also have

    $dbid = $adaptor->store($obj);

which stores the object. Currently the storing of an object also causes
the objects to set

    $obj->dbID

correctly and attach the adaptor.


Other fetch functions go by the convention of

    @object_array = $adaptor->fetch_by_XXXX($arguments_for_XXXX)

sometimes it returns an array, sometimes an individual object depending on the
semantics to XXXX. For example

    $gene = $gene_adaptor->fetch_by_stable_id($stable_id);

or

    @fp  = $simple_feature_adaptor->fetch_by_contig($contig_internal_id);


Occassionally adaptors need to provide access to lists of ids. In this case the
convention is to go list_XXXX, such as

    @gene_ids = $gene_adaptor->list_geneIds();

=cut

# Let the code begin...

package Bio::EnsEMBL::ExternalData::Family::DBSQL::BaseAdaptor;

use vars qw(@ISA);
use strict;
use Bio::EnsEMBL::Root;

@ISA = qw(Bio::EnsEMBL::Root);

sub new {
  my ($class,$dbobj) = @_;
  
  my $self = {};
  bless $self,$class;
  
  if( !defined $dbobj || !ref $dbobj ) {
    $self->throw("Don't have a db [$dbobj] for new adaptor");
  }
  
  $self->db($dbobj);
  
  return $self;
}

=head2 prepare

 Title   : prepare
 Usage   : $sth = $adaptor->prepare("select yadda from blabla")
 Function: provides a DBI statement handle from the adaptor. A convience
           function so you dont have to write $adaptor->db->prepare all the
           time
 Example :
 Returns : 
 Args    :


=cut

sub prepare {
  my ($self,$string) = @_;
  
  if (defined $string) {
    return $self->db->prepare($string);
  } else {
    $self->throw("No sql statemant giving as argument to prepare method!\n");
  }

}


=head2 db

 Title   : db
 Usage   : $obj->db($newval)
 Function: 
 Returns : value of db
 Args    : newvalue (optional)


=cut

sub db {
  my ($self, $value) = @_;

  if (defined $value) {
    $self->{'db'} = $value;
  }

  return $self->{'db'};
}


=head2 deleteObj

 Title   : deleteObj
 Usage   : $obj->deleteObj
 Function: removes memory cycles. Probably triggered by Root deleteObj
 Returns : 
 Args    : none


=cut

sub deleteObj {
  my ($self) = @_;

  my @dummy = values %{$self};

  foreach my $key ( keys %$self ) {
    delete $self->{$key};
  }

  foreach my $obj (@dummy) {
    eval {
      $obj->deleteObj;
    }
  }

}

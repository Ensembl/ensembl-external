=head2 fetch_by_dbID

 Title   : fetch_by_dbID
 Usage   : $memberadaptor->fetch_by_dbID($id);
 Function: fetches a FamilyMember given its internal database identifier
 Example : $memberadaptor->fetch_by_dbID(1)
 Returns : a Bio::EnsEMBL::ExternalData::Family::FamilyMember object if found, 
           undef otherwise
 Args    : an integer

=cut

sub fetch_by_dbID {
  my ($self, $dbID) = @_;

  $self->throw("dbID arg is required\n") unless ($dbID);

  my $constraint = "fm.family_member_id = $dbID";

  my $members = $self->_fetch_family_members($constraint);

  return undef if(!@$members);

  return $members->[0];
}

=head2 fetch_by_stable_id

 Title   : fetch_by_stable_id
 Usage   : $memberadaptor->fetch_by_stable_id($stable_id);
 Function: fetches a FamilyMember given its stable identifier 
           (external_member_id)
 Example : $db->fetch_by_stable_id('ENSG00000000009');
 Returns : a array ref of Bio::EnsEMBL::ExternalData::Family::FamilyMembers
           IMPORTANT: this method returns an array reference because the 
                      stable_id could not be unique
           i.e. the same member maybe part of more than one family
 Args    : an EnsEMBL Gene/Peptide stable id (e.g. ENSG00000000009) or 
           an Accession Number (e.g.O35622)
